This is a repository for the paper titled "Bayesian network modelling of phosphorus pollution in agricultural catchments with high-resolution data".
There area several R files aimed at the analysis of the BBN developed in this study:

DischargeDistributions.Rmd - a file detailing the bootstrapping procedure aimed at obtaining monthly discharge distributions for the BBN.

TurbidityDistributions.Rmd - a file detailing the bootstrapping procedure aimed at obtaining monthly turbidity distributions for the BBN.

Genie_Results.Rmd - a file detailing the code used for the analysis of the BBN results.

figures_for_publication.Rmd - a file detailing the code used to obtain the figures used in the publication.
